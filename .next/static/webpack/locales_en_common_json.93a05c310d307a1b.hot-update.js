Although our participants have found themselves experiencing a significant amount of hardship, there is little that can be done to prevent the Latino spirit from perservering. However, things could be made easier for them. During our interviews, we heard that our participants have a hard time accessing medical care and basic health services. For those that are experiencing Long COVID, they are often forced to return to work prematurely to make ends meet and take care of their families. This reality could be improved upon, and we hope to inspire a part of that change.","home_p3":"Eastern Washington is home to some of the most beautiful sceneries that exist in the United States. The most notable feature of this landscape is undoubtably the tall mountains and wide rivers. However, this beautiful environment brings about significant challenges to the people living there. The cold winters often make working out in the orchards and fields difficult, and the closest medical facility may be a few miles out of reach. Our participants have proven themselves to be optimistic individuals despite the challenges that they face.","aboutTitle1":"Our Thesis","aboutText1":"The lack of access to quality medical and health services, coupled with inadequate information and education about Long Covid has resulted in a public health crisis disproportionately affecting Latino communities in Eastern Washington, particularly those from low-income and rural backgrounds. This crisis is further exacerbated by a shortage of medical infrastructure, mistrust of the government, and limited financial assistance for medical treatments. To address this issue, there needs to be a comprehensive government intervention and policy reform that addresses these underlying issues and provides resources for training in the assessment and treatment of Long COVID and increasing the number of Spanish-speaking providers in Eastern Washington. To meet the needs of communities impacted by Long Covid, community-based organizations need to be empowered with education about the illness and research-driven plans for assistance.","aboutTitle2":"Who we are","aboutText2":"We are a group of 14 undergraduate students from the University of Washington Information School coming from all different backgrounds and concentrations. Led by Frank Martinez and Dr. Leo Morales, in partnership with the UW Latino Center for Health and Adios COVID, we have been brought in to research Long COVID—a little-known problem affecting communities across the world. Being from a Washington-based University, it was decided that we would uncover how Long COVID is affecting the population in our great state, in particular, Latinos in Eastern Washington. Throughout our 10-week quarter, we have developed this website and created an open-source research system, collecting data from both field and pre-existing research.

","aboutTitle4":"Our Team","data-heading1":"How We Collect Data","data-heading2":"Data & Findings","data_p1":"Our team gathered two types of datasets: qualitative and quantitative data. Qualitative data was collected through surveys and interviews focused on the social aspects affecting individuals with Long COVID. The collected data was anonymized to protect the privacy of participants, with any identifying indicators removed. In addition, we collected quantitative data by performing web scraping and aggregating demographic data from Grant, Douglas, Okanogan, Lincoln, Ferry, Stevens, and Pend Oreille. These datasets were primarily obtained from the U.S. Census, the Washington State Department of Health, the Bureau of Labor Statistics, and the Pew Research Center. To ensure accuracy and consistency, we cleaned and normalized these datasets using Jupyter Notebook.","data_p2":"Based on our extensive research, we have determined that approximately 90,000 Latinos may be suffering from Long COVID, representing approximately 9-10% of the total Latino population. Those with more severe hospitalized conditions have a higher probability of developing Long COVID. Individuals under 18 years of age have a lower probability of developing Long COVID, while those in older age groups have the highest probability. Our research also indicates that female Latinos have a relatively higher probability of developing Long COVID. Even among individuals who were not hospitalized, females have approximately 6% higher probability of experiencing Long COVID compared to males.","form-title":"Submit Your Data","form-content":"Share your own experience with long covid to help us!","form-content2":"We have google form that you can fill out.
