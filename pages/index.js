Although our participants have found themselves experiencing a significant amount of hardship, there is little that can be done to prevent the Latino spirit from perservering. However, things could be made easier for them. During our interviews, we heard that our participants have a hard time accessing medical care and basic health services. For those that are experiencing Long COVID, they are often forced to return to work prematurely to make ends meet and take care of their families. This reality could be improved upon, and we hope to inspire a part of that change.</p>

//                     <p class="home_p3"> Eastern Washington is home to some of the most beautiful sceneries that exist in the United States. The most notable feature of this landscape is undoubtably the tall mountains and wide rivers. However, this beautiful environment brings about significant challenges to the people living there. The cold winters often make working out in the orchards and fields difficult, and the closest medical facility may be a few miles out of reach. Our participants have proven themselves to be optimistic individuals despite the challenges that they face.</p>
