                    The lack of access to quality medical and health services, coupled with inadequate information and education about Long Covid 
                    has resulted in a public health crisis disproportionately affecting Latino communities in Eastern Washington, particularly those 
                    from low-income and rural backgrounds. This crisis is further exacerbated by a shortage of medical infrastructure, mistrust of the government, 
                    and limited financial assistance for medical treatments. To address this issue, there needs to be a comprehensive government intervention and 
                    policy reform that addresses these underlying issues and provides resources for training in the assessment and treatment of Long COVID and increasing 
                    the number of Spanish-speaking providers in Eastern Washington. To meet the needs of communities impacted by Long Covid, community-based organizations
                     need to be empowered with education about the illness and research-driven plans for assistance.

                    We are a group of 14 undergraduate students from the <a href = "https://ischool.uw.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">University of Washington Information School </a> 
                    coming from all different backgrounds and concentrations. Led by Frank Martinez and Dr. Leo Morales, in partnership with the UW 
                    <a href = "https://latinocenterforhealth.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Latino Center for Health </a> and Adios COVID, we have been brought in to 
                    research Long COVIDâ€”a little-known problem affecting communities across the world. Being from a Washington-based University, it was decided that we would uncover how Long COVID 
                    is affecting the population in our great state, in particular, Latinos in Eastern Washington. Throughout our 10-week quarter,
                    we have developed this website and created an open-source research system, collecting data from both field and pre-existing
                    research. To learn more about everyone involved, scroll down.
