# ¡Adiós COVID! 
## _Long COVID Research Web Development Team Repository_

This repository holds the code that creates the website for the Long COVID Research Web Development Team. The website is built under the structure of NextJS. 

## Purpose
The purpose of this research was to discover how Latino population from Eastern Washington State in rural areas are affected by Long COVID. 

## Our Thesis
The lack of access to quality medical and health services, coupled with inadequate information and education about Long Covid has resulted in a public health crisis disproportionately affecting Latino communities in Eastern Washington, particularly those from low-income and rural backgrounds. This crisis is further exacerbated by a shortage of medical infrastructure, mistrust of the government, and limited financial assistance for medical treatments. To address this issue, there needs to be a comprehensive government intervention and policy reform that addresses these underlying issues and provides resources for training in the assessment and treatment of Long COVID and increasing the number of Spanish-speaking providers in Eastern Washington. To meet the needs of communities impacted by Long Covid, community-based organizations need to be empowered with education about the illness and research-driven plans for assistance.
